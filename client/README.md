# Frontend repository of our project ASK_IIITM

## CONTRIBUTED BY: PRATEEK NANDLE , RAJAT SINGH , SARTHAK JAIN

This is a 3 month long project developed by us under the guidance of ## Dr. Santosh Singh Rathore .

## PROJECT DISCRIPTION :

We as a team tried to come up with a solution for the problems we faced in our early college journey.
We were unaware about a lot of stuff related to library to coding cometition to internship opportunities and so many other minute things and going for help from one senior to other was a cumbersome and time consuming task.
So, keeping all this in mind we came up with an idea of creating a web-based community which follows the very gaint rule of democracy -" for the students, by the students, to the students.

## Feautures of our web-

### The web provides-

### a platform to ask and answer questions related to students personal and proffesional life.

### a platform for both seniors and alumini to post opportunities related to upcoming internships , job profiles and roadmaps

### a platform for all our seniors, juniors and mentors to share stuff which they deeply care, or some unforgettable college moments , or an experience they want to share to the community through blog section.

### a platform , which we tried to create as highly interactive as we can, so that students can indulge in fruitfull disccusion through comments, like share and post section.

### a platform for individuals to showcase their achievements on profile section , so that students can ask their doubts to individuals who are pro in a particular field.

## Contact us / Suggestion

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
