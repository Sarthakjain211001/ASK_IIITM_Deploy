This is a 3 month long project developed by us under the guidance of ## Dr. Santosh Singh Rathore .

## PROJECT DISCRIPTION :

We as a team tried to come up with a solution for the problems we faced in our early college journey.
We were unaware about a lot of stuff related to library to coding cometition to internship opportunities and so many other minute things and going for help from one senior to other was a cumbersome and time consuming task.
So, keeping all this in mind we came up with an idea of creating a web-based community which follows the very gaint rule of democracy -" for the students, by the students, to the students.

## Feautures of our web-

### The web provides-

### a platform to ask and answer questions related to students personal and proffesional life.

### a platform for both seniors and alumini to post opportunities related to upcoming internships , job profiles and roadmaps

### a platform for all our seniors, juniors and mentors to share stuff which they deeply care, or some unforgettable college moments , or an experience they want to share to the community through blog section.

### a platform , which we tried to create as highly interactive as we can, so that students can indulge in fruitfull disccusion through comments, like share and post section.

### a platform for individuals to showcase their achievements on profile section , so that students can ask their doubts to individuals who are pro in a particular field.
